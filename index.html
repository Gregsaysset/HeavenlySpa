            <p>
                From the moment you arrive, you’ll soon realize 
                the Heavenly Spa is like no other. Your Heavenly Spa was created to give you the 
                ultimate experience of escape and indulgence you deserve. We believe your day at the spa should 
                be more than just a great spa treatment, it should be a great "experience" from the moment you 
                arrive until the moment you leave. Enjoy the ambiance, a nice glass of wine, cocktail or teas, 
                and of course, a great massage, facial, manicure/pedicure.          
                At the Heavenly Spa, you’ll find it is not the journey but the “destination."  We invite you 
                to see for yourself! Come to your senses. Come Home to Heavenly Spa.
